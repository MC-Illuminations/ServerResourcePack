# Welcome to the MCIlluminations Server Resource Pack Repository

This repository serves as the central hub for developing the MCI server resource pack.

## Developing the Pack  
**Please don’t use this repo as your development source.**  
Instead, download the pack locally by clicking [here](https://github.com/MC-Illuminations/ServerResourcePack/archive/refs/heads/main.zip). Once downloaded, edit the files on your system, and then push your changes to your branch when you’re ready.

## How to correctly use the repo.
To correctly contribute to the resource pack, **please avoid committing directly to the `main` branch**. Instead:  
1. Create a new **development branch** for your changes.  
2. Commit your updates to this branch.  
3. Submit a **pull request** to merge your changes into the `main` branch.  
   *(You are welcome to review and approve your own pull requests if appropriate.)*

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This may take up to 1 minute to build and deploy. Please be patient.
> You can view it building [here](https://github.com/MC-Illuminations/ServerResourcePack/actions).
